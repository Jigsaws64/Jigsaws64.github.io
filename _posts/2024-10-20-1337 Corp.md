## Determining atypical activity

First, let's determine if there's any external IP addresses attempting to communicate with the system

```spl
index=* source="1337CorpFirewall[1][1][1].csv" 
| table _time, src_ip, src_port, dest_ip, dest_port, bytes_in, bytes_out
```

We'll will pipe our results to the `table` command for betting formatting while searching for relevant information

![Lowest IP](/assets/images/Other/Lowest%20IP.png)

![Highest IP](/assets/images/Other/Highest%20IP.png)

All IP addresses coming from `src-ip` to the firewall are private IP addresses. This confirms there are ***no external IPs*** attempting to communicate with the firewall provided by the firewall log that was given

## Discovering brute-force / Failed Logon

First I'll try to find any failed login attempts

```splunk
index=* source="1337CorpADServer[1][1][1].csv" | search "login" OR "authentication" OR "logged" OR "failed" | table _time, user, src_ip
```

![Nothing Found](/assets/images/Other/No%20failed%20logins.png)

Unable to find any failed logins, let's look for logins within a short time period

```splunk
index=* source="1337CorpADServer[1][1][1].csv" "User Logged On" 
| timechart span=5m count by User
```

![Logins](/assets/images/Other/Logins%20final.png)

We see that `all 19 users` have ***hundreds of logins***, and all logins occurred exactly at the same time `9:44 PM on 10/21/2024`

```splunk
index=* source="1337CorpSchedule[1][1][1].csv" | table UserID, In, Out, "Remote Access" | sort UserID
```

![Users](/assets/images/Other/Users.png)

Looking at our schedule, only 10 of the users have remote access, and `NONE` are in after 5:00pm

This suggests there might be a script running for some sort of automation task. Let's check the system logs.

```splunk
index=* source="1337CorpSysLogs[1][1][1].csv"| search "started" OR "cron" OR "task" OR "script" OR "backup" OR "monitoring" | table _time, User, Host Name, Message
```

![ADM1N](/assets/images/Other/ADM1N.png)

The system logs show that a user by the name of `ADM1N` started an FTP client at `9:35 PM` & `9:45 PM` which is very close to the login spike from earlier

This suggest that this account has something to with data transfers

Let's looking into this ADM1N user further

![ADMIN2](/assets/images/Other/ADM1N2.png)

We see a sequence of events (log on, start FTP, log off), on `TestSystem` which suggests that ADM1N might be running a script to automate file transfers or data synchronization

### Checking if this is malicious

Here I'm going to search for FTP data that was sent during the time frame of the logins from earlier

```splunk
index=* source="1337CorpFirewall[1][1][1].csv"
| where _time >= strptime("2024-10-21 21:35:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") 
AND _time <= strptime("2024-10-21 21:45:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
| search dest_port=20 OR dest_port=21
| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, bytes_out
| sort - bytes_out
```

![Data Transfers](/assets/images/Other/Data%20Transfers.png)

Our query shows many connections via FTP to external IP addresses, suggesting malicious outbound data transfer

Let's gather all unique external IP addresses during this time

```splunk
index=* source="1337CorpFirewall[1][1][1].csv"
| where _time >= strptime("2024-10-21 21:35:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") 
        AND _time <= strptime("2024-10-21 21:45:38", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
| stats dc(dest_ip) as unique_count by dest_ip
| table dest_ip
```

![external IPs](/assets/images/Other/external%20IPs.png)

After downloading the CSV file, we can run it against a python script using the VirusTotal API

![No Malicious IP found](/assets/images/Other/No%20malicious%20reports.png)

Unfortunately, I am rate limited on the free version of the API. However, we don't see any malicious reports

### Conclusion

1. Mass user logins at 9:44 - outside of scheduled working hours
2. FTP transfers from all users immediately after logins
3. The ADM1N account initiating FTP activity before and after these events
4. No malicious reports on these IPs

## Reasonable explanations

- Unauthorized data exfiltration by insider threat or compromised ADM1N account after hours (most likely)
- Legitimate automated backup traffic (less likely)

## Next steps

- Investigate the data that was transferred
- Audit the ADM1N account / user
