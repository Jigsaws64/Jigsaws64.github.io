## Enumeration

Let's run [Nmap](https://nmap.org/book/toc.html) against our box at `10.10.10.7`


| Port      | State | Service        | Version                                         |
|-----------|-------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|

| 25/tcp    | open  | smtp           | Postfix smtpd                                   |
| 80/tcp    | open  | http           | Apache httpd 2.2.3                              |

| 143/tcp   | open  | imap           | Cyrus imapd 2.3.7-Invoca-RPM                    |
| 443/tcp   | open  | ssl/http       | Apache httpd 2.2.3 (CentOS)                     |
| 793/tcp   | open  | status         | Version 1 (RPC #100024)                         |
| 993/tcp   | open  | ssl/imap       | Cyrus imapd                                     |
| 995/tcp   | open  | pop3           | Cyrus pop3d                                     |
| 3306/tcp  | open  | mysql          | MySQL (unauthorized)                            |
| 4190/tcp  | open  | sieve          | Cyrus timsieved 2.3.7-Invoca-RPM                |
| 4445/tcp  | open  | upnotifyp?     |                                                 |
| 4559/tcp  | open  | hylafax        | HylaFAX 4.3.10                                  |
| 5038/tcp  | open  | asterisk       | Asterisk Call Manager 1.1                       |
| 10000/tcp | open  | http           | MiniServ 1.570 (Webmin httpd)                   |

As always, let's check out the log hanging fruit first and check the apache web server

![Secure Connection failed](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20Beep/Secure%20Conection%20Failed.png)

We get a `Secure Connection Failed` error with the error code `SSL_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION` which obviously tells us the server is using outdated version of SSL/TLS. Modern web browsers only support a minimum version of these as it poses a security risk

We can manually lower the minimum supported version in our browser by typing `about:config`

![FF Config](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20Beep/FF%20Config.png)

Now let's search for `tls`

![Min Version](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20Beep/TLS%20Min.png)

As we can see, we can edit the minium version from 3 to something lower. In our case, let's set it to `1`

Now that the minium tls version is set to 1 in our browser, let's navigate to the web server

![Elastix](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20Beep/elastix.png)

We come across this Elastix login screen. [Elastix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastix_(image_registration)) is an open-source unified communications software. This type of software integrates various communication tools, such as voice, video, fax, I.M, etc into one platform

Anyway, now that we can access the web server. Let's run a dirbuster on it

```bash
# -k option for Ignore SSL certificate errors

gobuster dir -u https://10.10.10.7 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -k
```

### Method #1

Googling for exploits against elastix reveals the following from exploitDB

![Graph.php LFI](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20Beep/graph.php%20LFI.png)

This [article](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37637) showcases an LFI vulnerability in the `graph.php` in the `vtigercrm` component file for Eslastix 2.2.0. 

The vulnerability arises from improper sanitization of the `current_language` parameter in `graph.php` We may be able to abuse this to read local files on the system

If applicable, we can abuse this to read the `/etc/amportal.conf` file which is the FreePBX config file

![LFI Exploited](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20Beep/LFI%20exploited.png)

Awesome, it looks like the LFI works. Parsing this text, we get some usernames & passwords:

| **Username**          | **Password**       | **Purpose**                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AMPDBUSER             | asteriskuser       | Username for connecting to the FreePBX database.                                               |
| AMPDBPASS             | amp109             | Password for the `AMPDBUSER` to access the FreePBX database.                                   |
| AMPDBPASS             | jEhdIekWmdjE       | An alternative password for the `AMPDBUSER`, likely used due to a misconfiguration in the file. |
| AMPMGRUSER            | admin              | Username for accessing the Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI), which allows for remote control.  |
| AMPMGRPASS            | jEhdIekWmdjE       | Password for the `AMPMGRUSER`, granting access to the AMI.                                     |
| FOPPASSWORD           | jEhdIekWmdjE       | Password for the Flash Operator Panel (FOP), which is used for managing calls in real-time.     |
| ARI_ADMIN_USERNAME    | admin              | Username for the Asteris

These credentials are essential for managing the FreePBX system. It's always a good idea to check for password reuse. Let's try to SSH as root against these 3 passwords

![Error](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20Beep/Key%20Exchange%20Error.png)

We get a `kex error` which indicates that the SSH server is offering a key exchange method that our SSH client doesn't accept

We can run the following command to pass the necessary SSH configuration

```bash
# -o flag is used to pass SSH config options

ssh -o KexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -o HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa,ssh-dss root@10.10.10.7
```

Since we only have a few different passwords to try, we can just enter them manually

![Root #1](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20Beep/Root%201%20Beep.png)

#### Summary 
And with that, we have root. The password we obtained via the LFI  on `graph.php` allowed us to exploit the `current_language` parameter to include local files from the server. In our case, we accessed `/etc/amportal.conf` which is a config file related to FreePBX. The config file has some password which we simply used to SSH onto the machine as the password was reused.

Let's move onto different compromises in the event that a password reuse didn't work

### Method #2

Assuming that LFI didn't work, we would have then moved to enumerating directories

![Directories](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20Beep/Directories.png)

We see `/admin`. Navigating to that directory prompts us to login, which we can't. After hitting cancel, we get directed to another page

![FreePBX](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20Beep/FreePBX.png)

FreePBX is a web-based open-source GUI that controls and mangers Asterisk (a voice-over-IP system)

Notice the `FreePBX 2.8.1.4` version beneath the logo

As always with version numbers listed, let's google for FreePBX 2.8.1.4 exploit

![CVE](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20Beep/CVE%202014-7235.png)

We come across this [CVE-2014-7235](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-7235), in which there appears to be a RCE vulnerability in FreePBX versions prior to 2.11.1.5

The exploit allows attackers to exploit improper handling of the `ari_auth` cookie, which is unsafely passed to PHP's `unserialize()` function, which can be exploited to inject malicious code and achieve RCE
